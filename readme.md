# PHP In Seattle

There are a lot of companies in Seattle, and it is hard to keep track. If you 
know of any PHP companies with offices in the Seattle area, add them here. A 
couple of guidelines:

* PHP should be a significant part of their software stack  
* Need to have a presence in the Seattle Area
* No recruiting/staffing companies
* Try to limit to companies within 20 miles
